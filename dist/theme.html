        The price you pay for coding on the edge

    <p>Every developer will sooner or later in her carreer make a concious choice what will compromise the weapons of choice. Starting with you favorite hardware and OS and including your favorite programming language and tool chain a lot of decicions need to be made.</p>

<h2 id="a-decade-worth-of-failures">A decade worth of failures</h2>

<p>I started my ongoing affair with my weapon of choice about 10 years ago, when I was introduced to the miracles and wonders of Zope. Back than ahead of its competition and introducing the idea of through-the-web, the so called TTW development. The Zope management interface - short ZMI - made it possible to actually build complex dynamic webpages and portals in a straight forward manner. This was both a joy to use for a newcomer like me but also served somehow as entry drug.</p>

<p>As my code started to move to the filesystem and gradually away from the ZMI my focus ever so slowly shifted to the filesystem, *Nix system administration, Python packaging, deployment tools, monitoring, deployment, etcetera.</p>

<p>Nowadays I even tend to get obsessed with optimizing my local development setup to squeeze out every bit of productivity end effectivness I can. But I will elaborate on this part of
my daily chores in a later post.</p>

<h2 id="systems-evolve-and-so-do-developers">Systems evolve and so do developers?</h2>

<p>We use the enterprise content management system Plone and try our best to keep all our running installs and projects as close to the latest stable version. This is a constant struggle that can only be undertaken with discipline and careful planing of the system architecture when it comes to deploying customer sites.</p>

<p>But after all these years I am getting bored with the status quo and usually we use a slightly newer setup and strive to keep ahead of time: the current stable development version has always been used in production during the last couple of years.</p>

<p>But sometimes your weapon of choice fails you. Newer development versions get installed automatically and interfere with your carefully crafted project setup.</p>

<p>Today we had to debug a suddently empty navigation box only to find out the the underlying template had changed. This update fixes a yearlong annoyance and finally uses an &#8216;ul&#8217; for the navigation items listing. But nevertheless an unexpected update took place that demanded for a hotfix (this will probably be explained in a seperate post as well).</p>

<h3 id="so-what">So what?</h3>

<p>Accidents will happen and no matter how careful you plan your setup and version pin all project resources there is a price you pay for living on the very edge. Upstream changes might affect your current project so always be prepared. As long as only our local development setup breaks all is not lost.</p>

<p>I am convinced that the price we pay is worth the benefits to be had. We have things mostly up to date and under our control. The time spend for hotfixes like todays chores are an annoyance but nothing compared to the hours of development and upgrade work we spare by doing these small tests and incremental updates in our everyday work.</p>

<p>Optimize a little bit every day and the benefits will outweight the small problems that sometimes slow down development.</p>

    <p>There is a severe problem arising from the fact that both customer and contractor seem to change after the project deadline has been reached.</p>

<h2 id="the-agile-dilemma">The agile dilemma</h2>

<p>Trying to sell an agile approach to project management to clients is sometimes more than difficult. After reading the <a href="http://8gramgorilla.com/why-clients-should-be-more-agile/">Why clients should be more agile</a> I have been thinking about wether we as contractors
simply fail to convince our customers of the benefits of going agile or if our clients are not ready for such a radical change in culture yet.</p>

<h3 id="three-simple-truths---so-hard-to-believe">Three simple truths - so hard to believe</h3>

<p>I am convinced that these hold true about every software development project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Itâ€™s impossible to gather all of the requirements at the start of the project.</li>
  <li>Whatever requirements you do gather are guaranteed to change.</li>
  <li>There will always be more to do than time or budget will allow.</li>
</ul>

<p>While it is perfectly natural for every developer and web consulting company to embrace the bittersweet truth behind these three facts of life, clients seem to disagree every once in a while and insist on trying to bend the universe as if it was possible to actually make an
exception just this once.</p>

<p>I often experience the best intentions being tossed overboard after deadlines have been meet. The first day after a new application, web app or site goes into production all principles and asumptions that held true during development somehow do not make it into the post-release project phase.</p>

<p>Contrary to the fact, that after moving the project into deployment we need to be double careful when running updates, since we are dealing with a running system, the client suddenly treats every small requirement as urgent and asumes ad hoc reaction on the development team part. It is correct that small bugs can be fixed fast and efficient without proper relase planing. Especially if you follow continuous integration precedures. Still the fact that new bugs get introduced just as fast as old chores get resolved goes mostly unnoticed.</p>
