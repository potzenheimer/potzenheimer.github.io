## Work

Learn more about my work and the projects I contribute on:

* [GitHub](https://github.com/potzenheimer).

I mostly develop web applications and intranet portals based in the enterprise open source
CMS Plone. the fun parts of my daily work might also involve a bit of Pyramid, Django, etc and a fair share of frontend tooling including CSS Preprocessors and the regular dose of Javascript (jquery, angular, backbone). Automating deployments (buildout, fabric, ansible) and running complex Linux server architectures based on Nginx, Varnish, HAProxy and friends.

* Developed on GitHub [GitHub](https://github.com/potzenheimer)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 3](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* No proprietary system was harmed by using Open Source
