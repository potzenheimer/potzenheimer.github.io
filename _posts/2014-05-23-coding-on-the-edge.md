title: The price you pay for coding on the edge

Every developer will sooner or later in her carreer make a concious choice what will compromise the weapons of choice. Starting with you favorite hardware and OS and including your favorite programming language and tool chain a lot of decicions need to be made.

# A decade worth of failures

I started my ongoing affair with my weapon of choice about 10 years ago, when I was introduced to the miracles and wonders of Zope. Back than ahead of its competition and introducing the idea of through-the-web, the so called TTW development. The Zope management interface - short ZMI - made it possible to actually build complex dynamic webpages and portals in a straight forward manner. This was both a joy to use for a newcomer like me but also served somehow as entry drug.

As my code started to move to the filesystem and gradually away from the ZMI my focus ever so slowly shifted to the filesystem, *Nix system administration, Python packaging, deployment tools, monitoring, deployment, etcetera.

Nowadays I even tend to get obsessed with optimizing my local development setup to squeeze out every bit of productivity end effectivness I can. But I will elaborate on this part of
my daily chores in a later post.

## Systems evolved and so do developers?

We use the enterprise content management system Plone and try our best to keep all our running installs and projects as close to the latest stable version. This is a constant struggle that can only be undertaken with discipline and careful planing of the system architecture when it comes to deploying customer sites.
